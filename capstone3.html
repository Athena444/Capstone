        <h3>Argument</h3>
        <p>Religion should not be so heavily incorporated in our laws and government, yet everywhere you look, you will find some sort of reference to God, especially the Christian or Catholic God that is dominantly believed in in the US. But just because these religions are dominant does not mean that the rest of the population that does not devote to them doesn't deserve representation in our government.</p>
        <p>According to the census of 2020, 70% of the population identifies as Christian or Catholic, leaving 30% of the population believing in another religion or no religion at all. God is mentioned everywhere in our law and government, the Pledge of Allegiance saying the phrase, “One nation, under God…”, along with many other state Constitutions mentioning God. The original Constitution doesn’t directly mention God, but references some sort of “higher being.” Research conducted by the Pew Research Center has allowed for them to write that, “God or the divine is mentioned at least once in each of the 50 state constitutions and nearly 200 times overall[...]”, and, “In addition to the 116 mentions of God, there are also 14 mentions of a Supreme or Sovereign Being, seven mentions of the ‘Creator,’ three mentions of ‘providence,’ four mentions of ‘divine’ and 46 instances of the word ‘almighty.’ While there are 32 mentions of the word ‘Lord,’ all but one refer to ‘the year of our Lord’ and so are not direct references to God. (Indeed, the U.S. Constitution also makes reference to ‘the year of our Lord.’) There also are seven mentions of the word ‘Christian.’” Having God frequently brought up in the Constitution and law system leads one to believe that Christian or Catholic morals are being incorporated with our laws that– especially as of recently– are affecting a person’s bodily rights (see <a href="capstone2.html">Article 2</a>.</p>
